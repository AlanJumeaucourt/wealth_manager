## üìä Views

### account_balances
Calculates current balance for each account based on all transactions.

This view:
- Combines incoming and outgoing transactions for each account
- Handles different transaction types (income, expense, transfer)
- Returns current balance by summing all transaction impacts
- Includes account metadata (name, type, user_id)

```sql
WITH transaction_impacts AS (
    -- Incoming transactions (positive impact)
    SELECT
        to_account_id as account_id,
        CASE
            WHEN type = 'income' THEN amount
            WHEN type = 'transfer' THEN amount
            ELSE 0
        END as amount
    FROM transactions
    UNION ALL
    -- Outgoing transactions (negative impact)
    SELECT
        from_account_id as account_id,
        CASE
            WHEN type = 'expense' THEN -amount
            WHEN type = 'transfer' THEN -amount
            ELSE 0
        END as amount
    FROM transactions
)
SELECT
    a.id as account_id,
    a.user_id,
    a.name as account_name,
    a.type as account_type,
    COALESCE(SUM(ti.amount), 0) as current_balance
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN transaction_impacts ti ON a.id = ti.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.user_id, a.name, a.type
```

## üî´ Triggers

### trg_validate_transaction
Validates transaction types and account combinations before insertion.

This trigger ensures:
- Income transactions:
  - Can only be received in checking, savings, or investment accounts
  - Must originate from an income account
- Expense transactions:
  - Can only be paid from checking, savings, or investment accounts
  - Must go to an expense account
- Transfer transactions:
  - Can only occur between checking, savings, or investment accounts

### trg_calculate_total_paid_investment_transaction
Automatically calculates the total amount paid for investment transactions.

This trigger:
- Fires after INSERT on investment_transactions
- Calculates total_paid as: (quantity √ó unit_price) + fee + tax
- Updates the record with the calculated total

### trg_calculate_total_paid_investment_transaction_update
Similar to above, but fires after UPDATE operations to maintain accuracy.

## üîó Entity Relationships

## üîê Data Integrity

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**
   - All relationships are enforced with ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Ensures referential integrity across all tables

2. **Type Validations**
   - Account types: 'investment', 'income', 'expense', 'checking', 'savings'
   - Transaction types: 'expense', 'income', 'transfer'
   - Investment activity types: 'buy', 'sell', 'deposit', 'withdrawal'

3. **Triggers**
   - Validates transaction types and account combinations
   - Automatically calculates total_paid for investment transactions
   - Updates account balances based on transactions

4. **Indexes**
   - Optimized queries for user-related operations
   - Efficient lookups for transactions and investments
   - Performance-oriented index structure for common operations
